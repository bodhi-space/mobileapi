# Bodhi Mobile API

##Overview
Mobile Container API

The Mobile API provides application developers access to native device features for use in web applications. These features are typically unavailable in the HTML5 specification, not uniformly supported across all mobile browsers or improve on the orginal HTML5 spec. In some cases new features have been added that combine several device characteristics into one, for example bar code scanning uses camera storage and image recognition.

There is only one API required to deliver applications on Android, iOs or Windows phones.
